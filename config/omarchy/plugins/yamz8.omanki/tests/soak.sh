# The unit tests exercise Anki.js, which is pure and knows nothing about
# processes, files, or two surfaces being open at once. Every bug this plugin
# has actually shipped lived in that gap and survived a green unit suite:
#
#   - the writer closed stdin after its first document and never reopened it,
#     so every save after the first in a shell session was silently dropped;
#   - each surface wrote the whole document from its own memory, so the bar
#     panel saving after the overlay had answered erased those answers.
#
# Both are invisible to a single action in a single surface, which is exactly
# how they were missed. This script does many actions, in both surfaces, and
# reads the file back after each one.
#
# It drives the real shell with real keystrokes, so it needs a running
# omarchy-shell, a working wtype, and the focus it takes while it runs. It is
# deliberately not part of the unit suite.
